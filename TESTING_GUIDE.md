## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### **Issue: Floating AI button not visible**
- **Fix**: Scroll down on profile page - button should be at bottom-right
- **Check**: z-index might be covered by modal - close any open modals

### **Issue: Natural Language Search not parsing**
- **Check**: Type at least 3 words (e.g., "Senior Engineers SF")
- **Check**: Use example queries first to verify functionality

### **Issue: Match scores not showing**
- **Check**: Candidates need email or GitHub data
- **Fix**: Try filtering for "Has Email" or "Has GitHub"

### **Issue: Quick Preview modal not opening**
- **Check**: Click "Preview" button, not the card itself
- **Alternative**: Hover over card and click from hover menu

### **Issue: Tabs not switching**
- **Check**: Click the tab name, not just hover
- **Check**: URL updates - if not, check browser console

### **Issue: Email template not generating**
- **Check**: Profile needs email data
- **Check**: Wait 1-2 seconds for AI generation
- **Check**: Browser console for API errors
