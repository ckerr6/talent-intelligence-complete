## Verification

Run these queries to verify migration success:

```sql
-- Total email coverage
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_people,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pe.person_id) as people_with_emails,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT pe.person_id) / COUNT(*), 2) as coverage_pct
FROM person p
LEFT JOIN person_email pe ON p.person_id = pe.person_id;

-- Check for duplicate emails per person (should be 0)
SELECT person_id, email, COUNT(*) 
FROM person_email
GROUP BY person_id, LOWER(email)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check people with multiple primary emails (should be 0)
SELECT person_id, COUNT(*) as primary_count
FROM person_email
WHERE is_primary = TRUE
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
