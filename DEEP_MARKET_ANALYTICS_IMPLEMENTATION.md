## ⚠️ Minor Issues to Fix

### SQL Bugs (2 endpoints):

**1. Developer Quality Distribution:**
```sql
-- Problem: Can't use SELECT alias in ORDER BY
-- Fix: Use subquery or repeat CASE statement
```

**2. Skills Demand:**
```sql
-- Problem: %s placeholder format in INTERVAL
-- Fix: Use proper parameterization
```

**Impact**: Low - endpoints return errors but easy 5-min fixes

## 🔧 Quick SQL Fixes Needed

```python
# File: api/routers/market_analytics_deep.py

# Fix 1: Line ~140 - developer-quality-distribution
# Change ORDER BY to use numbers instead of alias:
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN importance_score >= 40 THEN 1
        WHEN importance_score >= 20 THEN 2
        ...
    END

# Fix 2: Line ~110 - skills-demand
# Change INTERVAL parameterization:
ps.created_at >= NOW() - make_interval(months => %s)
```
