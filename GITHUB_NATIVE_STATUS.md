# GitHub Native Intelligence - Current Status

**Date**: October 24, 2025, 11:30 PM

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Database & Data
- **101,485 GitHub profiles** in database
- **5 profiles fully enriched** with deep intelligence:
  - @torvalds (Staff)  
  - @gaearon (Principal)
  - @gakonst (Principal)
  - @transmissions11 (Principal)
  - @haydenadams (Senior)

### 2. API Backend (`http://localhost:8000`)
- ‚úÖ Running and responsive
- New GitHub Intelligence endpoints:
  - `/api/github-intelligence/profiles/all` - Browse all profiles
  - `/api/github-intelligence/search` - Filter enriched profiles  
  - `/api/github-intelligence/profile/{username}` - Profile details
  - `/api/github-intelligence/stats` - Statistics

### 3. Frontend UI (`http://localhost:3001/github`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed and working
- Shows all 101K+ profiles
- Enriched profiles display:
  - Seniority badges (Principal, Staff, Senior, etc.)
  - Influence scores
  - Reachability scores
- Non-enriched profiles show "Not yet enriched" badge
- Real-time updates as profiles get enriched

### 4. Chrome DevTools MCP
- ‚úÖ Configured for Cursor
- Configuration added to:
  - `~/ Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json`
  - `.cursor/mcp.json` (workspace-specific)
- **Restart Cursor** to activate
- After restart, you'll have tools to:
  - Navigate to URLs
  - Take screenshots
  - Read console errors
  - Monitor network requests
  - Debug JS issues in real-time

## ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress

### Enrichment Process
The continuous enrichment script is created but having module import issues. Two options:

**Option A: Use the original orchestrator (recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/charlie.kerr/TI_Complete_Clone/talent-intelligence-complete
python3 scripts/github_intelligence/intelligence_orchestrator.py --mode existing --limit 1000
```

**Option B: Debug the continuous_enrichment.py script**
The simpler script at `scripts/github_intelligence/continuous_enrichment.py` needs import fixes.

## üìä Key Metrics

- **Total Profiles**: 101,485
- **Enriched**: 5 (0.005%)
- **To Enrich**: 101,480
- **Estimated Time** (at 5000 req/hour): ~20 hours for all
- **Rate Limit**: 0.72s between requests (respecting GitHub's 5000/hour limit)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Get enrichment running continuously**
   - Fix import issues in continuous_enrichment.py, OR
   - Use the original intelligence_orchestrator.py

2. **Test the UI** at http://localhost:3001/github
   - Browse profiles
   - Click into profile details
   - Watch as enrichment populates data

3. **Use Chrome DevTools MCP** (after Cursor restart)
   - Debug any frontend issues
   - Take screenshots for documentation
   - Monitor API calls

4. **Build remaining UI components**:
   - Market Dashboard
   - Network Graph visualization
   - Company intelligence pages

## üöÄ How to Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check enrichment status
psql -d talent -c "SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(updated_at) FROM github_intelligence;"

# Watch API logs
tail -f logs/api.log

# Watch enrichment logs  
tail -f logs/enrichment_continuous.log

# Check what's running
ps aux | grep -E "(python|node)" | grep -E "(run_api|continuous_enrichment|vite)"
```

```

**Bottom Line**: The platform is operational and showing your 101K profiles. The enrichment pipeline works (proven by 5 successful enrichments) but needs a proper background process setup. The UI is live and ready to use!
