## ENRICHMENT QUEUE

### Queue Statistics
- **Total people flagged:** 3,946
- **Status:** All pending re-review
- **Priority breakdown:**
  - **Priority 5 (High):** 2,761 people (have headline/job title data)
  - **Priority 3 (Medium):** 1,104 people (have location data)
  - **Priority 1 (Low):** 81 people (minimal data)

### Queue Table
**Table name:** `enrichment_queue`

**Schema:**
```sql
queue_id         UUID PRIMARY KEY
person_id        UUID (references person)
reason           TEXT ('bad_employment_data_deleted')
priority         INT (1-5)
status           TEXT ('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed')
attempts         INT
last_attempt     TIMESTAMP
created_at       TIMESTAMP
completed_at     TIMESTAMP
error_message    TEXT
metadata         JSONB (includes full_name, linkedin_url, etc.)
```

### Using the Queue

**View all pending enrichments:**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.full_name,
    p.linkedin_url,
    eq.priority,
    eq.created_at
FROM enrichment_queue eq
JOIN person p ON eq.person_id = p.person_id
WHERE eq.reason = 'bad_employment_data_deleted'
  AND eq.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY eq.priority DESC, p.full_name;
```

**Get next batch for processing:**
```sql
SELECT 
    eq.queue_id,
    eq.person_id,
    p.full_name,
    p.linkedin_url,
    eq.priority
FROM enrichment_queue eq
JOIN person p ON eq.person_id = p.person_id
WHERE eq.reason = 'bad_employment_data_deleted'
  AND eq.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY eq.priority DESC, eq.created_at
LIMIT 50;
```

**Mark as in progress:**
```sql
UPDATE enrichment_queue
SET status = 'in_progress',
    last_attempt = NOW(),
    attempts = attempts + 1
WHERE queue_id = '<queue_id>';
```

**Mark as completed:**
```sql
UPDATE enrichment_queue
SET status = 'completed',
    completed_at = NOW()
WHERE queue_id = '<queue_id>';
```

## SAMPLE OF AFFECTED PEOPLE

These people had bad employment records deleted but ALL their other data preserved:

| Name | LinkedIn | Priority | Other Data |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| Aaron Black | linkedin.com/in/aaronblacknyc | 5 | Has headline |
| Steven Madrid | linkedin.com/in/... | 5 | Has 6 OTHER good employment records |
| Léa Narzis | linkedin.com/in/... | 5 | Has 2 emails, 1 other job |
| Meghan Holleran | linkedin.com/in/... | 5 | Has 1 email |
| JB V | linkedin.com/in/... | 5 | Has 1 email, 1 other job |

**Note:** Many people in the queue still have OTHER valid employment records from different companies.

## VERIFICATION QUERIES

### Check cleanup was successful
```sql
-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_bad_companies
FROM company
WHERE company_name ~ '^[\.]*\s*(Ltd\.?|Inc\.?|LLC|Corporation|Limited|L\.?P\.?|P\.?C\.?)[\)\.\s]*$';

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) as bad_employment_records
FROM employment e
JOIN company c ON e.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE c.company_name IN ('Inc.', 'LLC', 'Ltd.', 'Limited', 'Corp.', 'Corporation', 'P.C.', 'L.P.');
```

### Check affected people still exist
```sql
-- Should return 3,946
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enrichment_queue 
WHERE reason = 'bad_employment_data_deleted';

-- Verify people still have their data
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_id) as people_exist,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pe.person_id) as people_with_emails,
    COUNT(DISTINCT gp.person_id) as people_with_github
FROM person p
LEFT JOIN person_email pe ON p.person_id = pe.person_id
LEFT JOIN github_profile gp ON p.person_id = gp.person_id
WHERE p.person_id IN (
    SELECT person_id FROM enrichment_queue 
    WHERE reason = 'bad_employment_data_deleted'
);
```

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Optional)
You can now manually review some of the flagged people to verify the cleanup was correct:
```bash
# Export a sample for manual review
psql -d talent -c "COPY (
    SELECT p.full_name, p.linkedin_url, eq.priority
    FROM enrichment_queue eq
    JOIN person p ON eq.person_id = p.person_id
    WHERE eq.reason = 'bad_employment_data_deleted'
    ORDER BY eq.priority DESC
    LIMIT 100
) TO STDOUT CSV HEADER" > /tmp/enrichment_sample.csv
```

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Review `ENRICHMENT_PIPELINE_TASKS.md` for re-scraping strategy
2. Decide on enrichment approach (LinkedIn API, manual, or gradual)
3. Test enrichment on 10 sample people

### Ongoing
1. **Quality filters are now active** - No new bad company names can be created
2. **Enrichment queue is ready** - Process when ready
3. **Monitoring in place** - Import logs will show any filtered company names

---

## DATA SAFETY

### Backups Available
1. **CSV Export:** `/tmp/bad_employment_records_export.csv` (4,175 records)
2. **Enrichment Queue Export:** `/tmp/enrichment_queue_employment.csv` (3,811 people)
3. **Database has all person data intact** - No person records were deleted

### Rollback (If Needed)
If you discover an issue and need to restore the deleted employment records:
```sql
-- Re-import from CSV (if needed)
\copy employment (employment_id, person_id, ...) 
FROM '/tmp/bad_employment_records_export.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

**Note:** Rollback is unlikely to be needed since:
- Only records with NULL titles and suffix-only companies were deleted
- All person data is preserved
- People with other good employment kept all their other jobs

---

## QUALITY FILTERS NOW ACTIVE

### Import Scripts Updated
The following scripts now reject suffix-only company names:
1. ✅ `scripts/imports/import_clay_people.py`
2. ✅ `scripts/imports/import_csv_datablend.py`

**What happens:** If an import tries to create a company named "Inc." or "Ltd.", it will:
- Log an error: `"Invalid company name skipped: Company name is only a legal suffix: 'Inc.'"`
- Return `None` for company_id
- Skip creating the employment record
- Continue processing other records

### Deduplication Script Updated
✅ `scripts/maintenance/deduplicate_companies.py`

**What happens:** Before grouping companies, it:
- Filters out suffix-only companies
- Logs how many were skipped
- Only deduplicates valid companies

### Validation Module
✅ `scripts/data_quality_filters.py`

**Functions available:**
- `is_valid_company_name()` - Validates company names
- `should_skip_company_deduplication()` - Filters for dedup
- `get_company_validation_message()` - Error messages

**Test coverage:** 16/16 tests passing ✅
