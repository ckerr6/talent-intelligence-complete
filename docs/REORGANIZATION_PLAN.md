# Repository Reorganization - Execution Plan

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Ready to Execute

---

## 🎯 What This Does

Cleans up the repository by:
1. ✅ **Moving 83+ files** from root to organized directories
2. ✅ **Creating clean structure** with `scripts/`, `sql/`, `data/`, `reports/` directories
3. ✅ **Archiving old status docs** to `archived_documentation/milestones/`
4. ✅ **Consolidating documentation** in `docs/`
5. ✅ **Updating README** with current accurate numbers (already done)

---

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Audit performed - see `REPOSITORY_AUDIT_2025.md`
- [x] README.md updated with accurate current numbers
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created
- [x] docs/README.md created (documentation navigation)
- [x] Reorganization script created (`reorganize_repository.py`)

### ⏳ Ready to Execute
- [ ] Run reorganization script (see below)
- [ ] Verify reorganization
- [ ] Update .gitignore
- [ ] Commit changes

---

## 🚀 How to Execute

### Step 1: Review the Plan

Read the audit to understand what will change:
```bash
cat REPOSITORY_AUDIT_2025.md
```

### Step 2: Dry Run (See What Will Happen)

**SAFE** - This won't move anything, just shows you what would happen:
```bash
cd /Users/charlie.kerr/TI_Complete_Clone/talent-intelligence-complete
python3 reorganize_repository.py
```

You'll see:
- All directories that will be created
- All files that will be moved
- Any files that will be skipped (already moved or not found)

### Step 3: Execute Reorganization

**LIVE MODE** - This will actually move files:
```bash
cd /Users/charlie.kerr/TI_Complete_Clone/talent-intelligence-complete
python3 reorganize_repository.py --execute
```

The script will:
1. Count down 5 seconds (you can Ctrl+C to cancel)
2. Create all new directories
3. Move all files to their new locations
4. Create README files for new directories
5. Generate a detailed log

### Step 4: Verify

Check that everything worked:
```bash
# Should see clean root directory
ls -la

# Should see new organized structure
ls -la scripts/
ls -la sql/
ls -la data/
ls -la reports/
ls -la logs/

# Check the log
cat reorganization_log_*.txt
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Script Path Updates

Some scripts have hardcoded paths and may need updates after reorganization:

**Will need updates:**
- Shell scripts (`.sh` files) that call Python scripts
- Any scripts that reference other scripts by path

**Won't need updates:**
- Scripts using `config.py` (uses absolute paths)
- API and dashboard (use relative imports)
- Database connections (unchanged)

### After Reorganization

You'll need to update these commands:

**BEFORE:**
```bash
python3 diagnostic_check.py
python3 import_clay_people.py
python3 match_github_profiles.py
```

**AFTER:**
```bash
python3 scripts/diagnostics/diagnostic_check.py
python3 scripts/imports/import_clay_people.py
python3 scripts/github/match_github_profiles.py
```

Or, better yet, run from the scripts directory:
```bash
cd scripts/diagnostics && python3 diagnostic_check.py
cd scripts/imports && python3 import_clay_people.py
cd scripts/github && python3 match_github_profiles.py
```

---

## 🔍 What If Something Goes Wrong?

### The script is safe because:

1. ✅ **Dry run first** - See exactly what will happen
2. ✅ **Checks before moving** - Won't overwrite existing files
3. ✅ **Detailed logging** - Every move is logged
4. ✅ **Git tracks everything** - Easy to revert
5. ✅ **No deletions** - Only moves files

### To undo changes:

```bash
# Option 1: Use git to revert
git status                    # See what changed
git checkout -- <file>        # Revert specific file
git reset --hard              # Revert everything (CAREFUL!)

# Option 2: Move files back manually
# Check reorganization_log_*.txt for exact moves
```

---

## 📝 Post-Reorganization Checklist

After running the reorganization:

### 1. Verify Structure
```bash
# Check new directories exist
ls -la scripts/ sql/ data/ reports/

# Check files moved correctly
ls -la scripts/diagnostics/
ls -la scripts/github/
ls -la sql/maintenance/
ls -la reports/current/
```

### 2. Update .gitignore
Add these patterns:
```
# Log files
*.log

# Report files  
*_report_*.txt

# Data files
*.csv
!data/sample/*.csv

# Database backups
*.db
!talent_intelligence.db
```

### 3. Test Key Scripts
```bash
# Test diagnostics
python3 scripts/diagnostics/diagnostic_check.py

# Test API still works
python3 run_api.py

# Test database connection
python3 config.py
```

### 4. Update Documentation Links

Check these files for broken links:
- [ ] README.md (already updated)
- [ ] docs/*.md
- [ ] Shell scripts (*.sh)

### 5. Commit Changes
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Repository reorganization: Clean structure with organized directories

- Moved 83 files to proper directories
- Created scripts/, sql/, data/, reports/ structure
- Updated README with current database stats (60K people, 100K GitHub)
- Added CHANGELOG.md and comprehensive docs/README.md
- Archived old status documents to milestones/

See REPOSITORY_AUDIT_2025.md for full details"

git push origin main
```
