```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Added to api.ts

- askAI(personId, question, conversationHistory?, provider?)
- getAIStatus()
```

### ProfilePage Integration
```typescript
// State management
const [aiSummary, setAiSummary] = useState<any>(null);
const [codeAnalysis, setCodeAnalysis] = useState<any>(null);
const [summaryLoading, setSummaryLoading] = useState(false);
const [analysisLoading, setAnalysisLoading] = useState(false);

// Handlers
handleGenerateSummary() - Calls API, updates state
handleAnalyzeCode() - Calls API, updates state
handleAskAI(question, history) - Returns answer
```
