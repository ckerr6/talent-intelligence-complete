**Endpoint**: `GET /api/market/hiring-patterns`

Analyzes company hiring over time:
- Monthly hiring volumes (time series)
- Top roles being hired
- Total hires in period
- Average employee tenure

```

**Returns**:
- Monthly breakdown of hires
- Most common titles
- Tenure metrics
- Strategic insights

---

### 2. 🔄 Talent Flow Analysis
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/market/talent-flow`

Tracks where talent comes from and goes to:
- **Inbound**: Feeder companies (where hires come from)
- **Outbound**: Destination companies (where people go)
- Person counts for each flow

**Example**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/market/talent-flow?company_name=Coinbase&direction=both"
```

**Use Cases**:
- Identify target companies for recruiting
- Understand competitive talent dynamics
- Track talent ecosystem
- Find feeder schools/companies

### 3. 💻 Technology Distribution
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/market/technology-distribution`

Analyzes tech stacks based on GitHub activity:

- Developer counts per technology
- Total contributions
- Repository counts

**Example**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/market/technology-distribution?company_name=Uniswap&limit=10"
```

**Real Result** (Uniswap):
- TypeScript: 4 developers, 1,919 contributions
- Solidity: 1 developer, 51 contributions
- JavaScript, Python, Shell...

---

### 4. 🤖 AI-Powered Market Questions
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/market/ask`

**The Game Changer!** Ask natural language questions and get strategic insights.

**Example Questions**:

- "Where does Coinbase recruit most of their talent from?"
- "What technologies are popular at DeFi companies?"
- "How does talent flow between Uniswap and Coinbase?"
- "What roles is Paradigm focusing on?"

**Real AI Response** (tested with Uniswap):
```json
{
  "question": "What are the hiring trends at Uniswap?",
  "answer": "### Direct Answer\nUniswap has not made any hires in the last 24 months...\n\n### Key Insights\n1. No New Hires - indicates hiring freeze\n2. Technology Focus - TypeScript heavy (1919 contributions)\n3. Average Tenure - 1.1 years suggests turnover concerns\n\n### Strategic Implications\n1. Talent Scarcity - scaling challenges ahead\n2. Skill Gaps - limited Solidity developers\n3. Retention Risks - high turnover potential\n\n### Recommendations\n1. Reassess Hiring Strategy\n2. Expand Tech Focus - hire Solidity experts\n3.
