## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Complete ‚úÖ)

**1. AI Service** (`api/services/ai_service.py`)
- Multi-provider architecture (OpenAI, Anthropic, extensible)
- Smart context building from all data sources
- Structured JSON responses
- Error handling and fallbacks
- ~600 lines of production-ready code

**2. API Endpoints** (`api/routers/ai.py`)
- `POST /api/ai/profile-summary` - Career summaries
- `POST /api/ai/code-analysis` - Technical analysis  
- `POST /api/ai/ask` - Interactive Q&A
- `GET /api/ai/status` - Provider availability

**3. Provider Support**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** (recommended for MVP)
  - Best cost/quality balance
  - ~$0.15 per 1M input tokens
  - ~$0.60 per 1M output tokens
  - ~$2-3 per 100 analyses
  
- **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (alternative)
  - Slightly higher quality for complex analysis
  - Good for comparison
  - Similar cost structure

**4. Data Integration**
- Fetches person profile
- Employment history
- Email availability
- GitHub profile and contributions
- All repositories with context
- Builds rich context for AI analysis

### Frontend (Next Step üîú)

Will add:
- **AI Summary Card** on profile pages
- **"Ask AI" Chat Interface** 
- **Code Analysis Section** in GitHub activity
- **Quick Action Buttons** ("Get AI Insights")

## How to Use Right Now

### 1. Set Your API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

Get your key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 2. Test the API

```bash
# Run the test script
./test_ai.sh

# Or test with specific person
./test_ai.sh "person-id-here"
```

### 3. Example: Get Profile Summary

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai/profile-summary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "person_id": "679c5f97-d1f8-46a9-bc1b-e8959d4288c2",
    "job_context": "Looking for a senior smart contract engineer",
    "provider": "openai"
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```

### 4. Example: Ask a Question

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "person_id": "679c5f97-d1f8-46a9-bc1b-e8959d4288c2",
    "question": "Do they have experience with DeFi protocols?",
    "provider": "openai"
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Cost Management

### Budget Estimates

**For $100-200/month you can do**:
- ~5,000-10,000 profile summaries
- Or ~15,000-30,000 quick Q&A queries
- Or mixed usage (more realistic)

**Smart strategies**:
1. **Cache results** - Store in `candidate_scores` table
2. **Selective generation** - Only for top candidates
3. **Batch overnight** - Generate for your shortlist
4. **On-demand** - Let recruiters trigger manually

### Cost per Operation

| Operation | Tokens | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| Profile Summary | ~2000 in, 500 out | ~$0.0006 | Full career analysis |
| Code Analysis | ~3000 in, 600 out | ~$0.0008 | GitHub deep dive |
| Q&A Question | ~1500 in, 300 out | ~$0.0004 | Quick answer |

**Real-world example**: 
- 100 candidates
- 1 summary + 1 code analysis + 2 questions each
- Total: ~$0.22 per candidate = **$22 for 100 candidates**

You're well within budget! üéâ

## Why This is Powerful

### For Non-Technical Recruiters

**Before**: 
- "This person has 500 commits to `@uniswap/v3-core`"
- "What does that mean? Is that good?"
- Spends hours trying to understand technical work
- Misses great candidates due to complexity

**After**:
- Click "Get AI Insights"
- See: "Senior protocol engineer with deep DeFi expertise. Built core components of Uniswap V3 (handling $1B+ in transactions). Strong Solidity skills, understands MEV protection and gas optimization. Perfect for senior smart contract roles."
- Ask: "How do they compare to our current team?"
- Get instant, accurate answer

### For Investor Demos

**The "Wow Moment"**:
1. Show a GitHub profile (confusing commit history)
2. Click "Explain this to me"
3. AI generates crystal-clear summary in 5 seconds
4. Ask follow-up: "Would they fit our portfolio company X?"
5. Get thoughtful comparison instantly

**Differentiation**:
- LinkedIn Recruiter: ‚ùå No AI, no GitHub integration
- Wellfound: ‚ùå Basic filters only
- Harmonic: ‚ùå No code analysis
- **You**: ‚úÖ AI that understands technical work + explains it clearly
