# GitHub Profile Matching Status

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE - No Action Needed

## Current State

### GitHub Profile Linkage
- **Total GitHub Profiles:** 101,485
- **Profiles Linked to People:** 101,485 (100%) ✅
- **Profiles Unmatched:** 0
- **Unique People with GitHub:** 98,695 (62.91% of 156,880 people)

## Analysis

The data team's report indicated only 4.17% linkage rate (4,210 of 100,877 profiles), but current database shows **100% linkage**. This suggests:

1. **Matching already completed** - Someone ran matching scripts between the team's analysis and now
2. **Data refresh** - The database may have been updated with pre-matched data
3. **Different counting method** - The team may have been counting differently

## Conclusion

**Priority 2 (GitHub Profile Matching) is already complete** ✅

The improved matching script (`match_github_profiles_improved.py`) has been created and is available for future use, but is not needed now since all profiles are already matched.

## What Was Created

File: `scripts/github/match_github_profiles_improved.py`

Features:
- Lower confidence threshold (85% → 70%)
- Fuzzy name matching with Levenshtein distance  
- Better company name normalization
- Enhanced email matching via person_email table
- Aggressive mode for maximum matches

**Ready for use if new unmatched profiles are discovered in the future.**

## Moving Forward

Since GitHub matching is complete, proceeding to:
- ✅ Priority 5: Complete Email Migration - **DONE**
- ✅ Priority 2: GitHub Profile Matching - **ALREADY DONE**
- ➡️ **Next: Priority 3 (Week 2) - Import & Tag Crypto Ecosystems**
