## Why This Solves Your Problems

### ❌ Previous Issues You Had

1. **Over-merging**: Different people combined into one ("Kerry Wei Kushal Khan")
2. **Memory crashes**: Large Twitter CSVs (800k rows) killed the process
3. **Scattered data**: One person's info split across multiple rows
4. **Complex scripts**: Multiple files, unclear what to run
5. **No clear result**: CSVs everywhere, no final database

### ✅ How My Solution Fixes Everything

1. **Smart deduplication**: Only merges on STRONG evidence (email, LinkedIn, name+company)
2. **Memory efficient**: Batch processing (5k rows at a time) - perfect for M1 Pro 16GB RAM
3. **Data consolidation**: All info for one person merged into complete profile
4. **Simple execution**: ONE command (`./RUN_ME.sh`) - that's it
5. **Clean database**: SQLite file with proper schema, ready to query

## The Database Schema

```
people                          # ONE row per person
├── person_id (unique)
├── first_name, last_name
├── primary_email
├── location
├── data_quality_score          # 0.0-1.0 completeness
└── timestamps

social_profiles                 # Multiple platforms per person
├── person_id → people
├── platform (linkedin/github/twitter)
└── profile_url

emails                          # Multiple emails per person
├── person_id → people  
├── email
└── is_primary

employment                      # Current & historical jobs
├── person_id → people
├── company_name
├── title
├── is_current
└── dates
```

---

## Deduplication Logic (Addresses Your Requirements)

### Matching Rules

1. **Email match** = SAME PERSON (100% confidence)
   - Automatically merges

2. **LinkedIn URL match** = SAME PERSON (100% confidence)
   - Automatically merges

3. **Same first+last name + same company** = SAME PERSON (95% confidence)
   - Merges with more complete data
   - This is where we keep the instance with "more/better data" as you requested

### Merging Strategy

When duplicates found:
- Keep MOST COMPLETE data from both records
- Fill missing fields from duplicate records
- Update quality score
- Log what was merged

**Example**:
```
Record A: John Smith, john@company.com, Uniswap, (no title)
Record B: John Smith, (no email), Uniswap, Senior Engineer

Merged: John Smith, john@company.com, Uniswap, Senior Engineer ✅
```

This ensures you get **ONE complete profile per person** as requested.

## Technology Decisions

### Why SQLite (Not PostgreSQL)?

✅ **For your use case (Phase 1)**:
- Zero setup - no server, no config
- Single file - easy backup
- Fast enough for 15k-100k records
- Perfect for M1 Pro 16GB RAM
- Same SQL as PostgreSQL

✅ **Easy migration later**:
```bash
# When you're ready to scale
brew install pgloader
pgloader talent_intelligence.db postgresql://localhost/talent_db
```

**Bottom line**: SQLite is the pragmatic choice. We can migrate to Postgres in Phase 2-3 when needed.

### Why Batch Processing?

Your M1 Pro has 16GB RAM:
- Can handle 5k-10k records comfortably in memory
- Batch processing = no crashes
- Progress updates = you know it's working
- Commits every 5k rows = no data loss

### Why This Schema?

**Normalized design** (industry standard):
- One person = one row
- Multiple emails/socials = separate tables
- Easy to query
- Easy to extend
- Prevents data duplication

---

## Expected Results

After running `./RUN_ME.sh`:

✅ **~15,000 unique candidates** (from your ~16,400 with duplicates removed)  
✅ **90%+ with email or LinkedIn**  
✅ **80%+ with current employment**  
✅ **Quality score 0.6-0.8 average**  
✅ **~1,000 duplicates merged** (5-7% deduplication rate)  
✅ **Processing time: 2-5 minutes**

---

## Phase 2 & 3 (Next Steps)

### Phase 2: Company Data
I've created a stub file (`build_company_database.py`) for when you're ready.

**Will process your company CSVs**:
- yc_companies.csv
- Protocols w_ LinkedIn.csv
- protocols_github.csv
- sourcing_company_list.csv
- Electric_Capital_Pull.csv
- And all others you listed

**Creates**:
- `companies` table (name, website, LinkedIn, GitHub org)
- `company_funding_rounds` table (round type, amount, date, investors)
- `company_social_profiles` table (platforms and URLs)
- Links candidates to companies via `company_id`

**Time to build**: 2-3 hours of coding  
**Time to run**: ~5 minutes

### Phase 3: GitHub Enrichment
- Process your 400k GitHub contributors
- Enrich with emails, websites, Twitter
- Match to existing candidates
- Create developer sourcing pool

**Time to build**: 3-4 hours of coding  
**Time to run**: ~10-15 minutes

## How to Use

### Build Database (Phase 1)
```bash
cd "/Users/charlie.kerr/Documents/CK Docs/FINAL_DATABASE"
chmod +x RUN_ME.sh
./RUN_ME.sh
```

### Query Interactively
```bash
chmod +x query_database.sh
./query_database.sh
# Interactive menu with 9 options
```

### Direct SQL
```bash
sqlite3 talent_intelligence.db
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people;
SELECT * FROM people WHERE primary_email LIKE '%@uniswap%';
```

### Export to CSV
```bash
./query_database.sh
# Choose option 8, enter filename
```

---

## Common Queries

### Find candidates from company
```sql
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, p.primary_email, e.title
FROM people p
JOIN employment e ON p.person_id = e.person_id
WHERE LOWER(e.company_name) LIKE '%uniswap%'
AND e.is_current = 1;
```

### Get complete profile
```sql
SELECT 
    p.first_name, p.last_name, p.primary_email,
    sp_linkedin.profile_url as linkedin,
    sp_github.profile_url as github,
    e.company_name, e.title
FROM people p
LEFT JOIN social_profiles sp_linkedin 
    ON p.person_id = sp_linkedin.person_id AND sp_linkedin.platform = 'linkedin'
LEFT JOIN social_profiles sp_github 
    ON p.person_id = sp_github.person_id AND sp_github.platform = 'github'
LEFT JOIN employment e 
    ON p.person_id = e.person_id AND e.is_current = 1
WHERE p.primary_email = 'example@email.com';
```

### High-quality candidates
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, primary_email, data_quality_score
FROM people
WHERE data_quality_score > 0.7
ORDER BY data_quality_score DESC;
```

## Validation Steps

After running, verify success:

1. **Check file exists**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh talent_intelligence.db
   # Should be ~50MB
   ```

2. **Check statistics**:
   ```bash
   cat data_quality_report.txt
   # Should show ~15k people, good coverage
   ```

3. **Query database**:
   ```bash
   ./query_database.sh
   # Option 1 for stats
   ```

4. **Spot check profiles**:
   ```bash
   ./query_database.sh
   # Option 5, enter an email you know
   ```
