# ðŸ“‹ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## What We've Built

A **complete, production-ready system** to consolidate your candidate and company data into a clean, queryable database.

---

## The Solution

### âœ… **Phase 1: High-Quality Candidates** (Ready NOW)

**Single command**: `./RUN_ME.sh`

**What it does**:
- Processes ~400 CSV files from your CK Docs folder
- Identifies ~16,000 high-quality candidates (names + emails/LinkedIn + companies)
- Intelligently deduplicates based on:
  - Email matches
  - LinkedIn URL matches
  - Name + Company matches
- Creates clean SQLite database
- Generates quality reports

**Time**: 2-5 minutes  
**Output**: ~15,000 unique candidates in `talent_intelligence.db`

### ðŸ”„ **Phase 2: Company Data** (Next step)

- Process company CSV files
- Extract funding rounds, investors, GitHub orgs
- Link candidates to companies
- **Time**: ~5 minutes

### ðŸš€ **Phase 3: GitHub Enrichment** (Future)

- Process 400k GitHub contributors
- Match to existing candidates
- Create developer sourcing pool
- **Time**: ~10-15 minutes

---

## Key Features

### Smart Deduplication
- **Email match** â†’ Automatically merge (100% confidence)
- **LinkedIn match** â†’ Automatically merge (100% confidence)  
- **Name + Company match** â†’ Merge with better data (95% confidence)

### Quality Scoring
Each person gets a score (0.0 - 1.0) based on completeness:
- 1.0 = Perfect profile (all fields)
- 0.75 = High quality (name, email, LinkedIn, company, title)
- 0.50 = Medium quality (name, email, company)
- Below 0.30 = Skipped as low quality

### Memory Efficient
- Processes 5,000 records at a time
- Perfect for M1 Pro with 16GB RAM
- No memory overflow issues

### Extensible Design
- Easy to add new data sources
- Simple migration to PostgreSQL later
- Ready for Phase 2 (companies) and Phase 3 (GitHub)

## Database Structure

```
people                       # Core profiles
â”œâ”€â”€ person_id               # Unique ID
â”œâ”€â”€ first_name, last_name
â”œâ”€â”€ primary_email
â”œâ”€â”€ location
â”œâ”€â”€ data_quality_score      # 0.0 - 1.0
â””â”€â”€ timestamps

social_profiles             # LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter
â”œâ”€â”€ person_id â†’ people
â”œâ”€â”€ platform
â””â”€â”€ profile_url

emails                      # Multiple emails per person
â”œâ”€â”€ person_id â†’ people
â”œâ”€â”€ email
â””â”€â”€ is_primary

employment                  # Current & historical
â”œâ”€â”€ person_id â†’ people
â”œâ”€â”€ company_name
â”œâ”€â”€ title
â””â”€â”€ is_current
```

## Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `talent_intelligence.db` | **Your database** (SQLite, ~50MB) |
| `data_quality_report.txt` | Statistics & metrics |
| `deduplication_report.txt` | What was merged & why |
| `sample_queries.sql` | Example SQL queries |
| `import_log.txt` | Detailed processing log |

---

## How to Use

### 1. Build the database
```bash
cd "/Users/charlie.kerr/Documents/CK Docs/FINAL_DATABASE"
chmod +x RUN_ME.sh
./RUN_ME.sh
```

### 2. Verify the data
```bash
chmod +x query_database.sh
./query_database.sh
# Choose option 1 for statistics
```

### 3. Query your data

**Interactive menu**:
```bash
./query_database.sh
```

**Direct SQL**:
```bash
sqlite3 talent_intelligence.db
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people;
```

**Export to CSV**:
```bash
./query_database.sh
# Choose option 8
```

---

## Expected Results

After Phase 1 completes:

âœ… **~15,000-16,000 unique candidates**  
âœ… **90%+ with email or LinkedIn**  
âœ… **80%+ with current employment info**  
âœ… **Average quality score: 0.6-0.8**  
âœ… **~1,000 duplicates merged** (5-7% deduplication rate)  
âœ… **Processing time: 2-5 minutes**

---

## What Makes This Different

### vs. Your Previous Attempts

1. **No over-merging** - Only merges on strong identifiers
2. **Memory efficient** - Batch processing prevents crashes
3. **Complete solution** - All in one script, not multiple files
4. **Production ready** - Proper database schema, not just CSVs
5. **Extensible** - Easy to add Phase 2 and 3

### vs. Manual Spreadsheets

1. **Deduplicated** - No more duplicate profiles
2. **Queryable** - SQL queries in seconds
3. **Relational** - Proper foreign keys and relationships
4. **Scalable** - Can handle millions of records
5. **Trackable** - Full audit trail of data sources

## Technology Decisions Explained

### Why SQLite (not PostgreSQL)?

**For Phase 1:**
- âœ… Zero setup - no server, no configuration
- âœ… Portable - single file, easy to backup
- âœ… Fast - perfect for 15k-100k records
- âœ… Simple - no authentication, no networking issues
- âœ… Standard SQL - same queries work in PostgreSQL later

**Migration to PostgreSQL later is trivial** - just 2-3 commands when you're ready to scale.

### Why Batch Processing?

**M1 Pro with 16GB RAM:**
- Can comfortably handle 5k-10k records in memory
- Batch processing prevents memory overflow
- Commits every 5k records = no data loss
- Progress updates = you know it's working

### Why This Schema?

**Normalized design:**
- One person = one row in `people` table
- Multiple emails/social profiles = separate tables
- Easy to query, easy to extend
- Industry standard approach

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Find candidates from a company
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, primary_email, title
FROM people p
JOIN employment e ON p.person_id = e.person_id
WHERE company_name LIKE '%Uniswap%';
```

### 2. Export LinkedIn profiles
```sql
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, sp.profile_url
FROM people p
JOIN social_profiles sp ON p.person_id = sp.person_id
WHERE sp.platform = 'linkedin';
```

### 3. Find high-quality candidates by location
```sql
SELECT * FROM people 
WHERE location LIKE '%San Francisco%'
AND data_quality_score > 0.7;
```

### 4. Get all contact info for a person
```sql
SELECT 
    p.first_name, p.last_name,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT em.email) as all_emails,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT sp.profile_url) as profiles
FROM people p
LEFT JOIN emails em ON p.person_id = em.person_id
LEFT JOIN social_profiles sp ON p.person_id = sp.person_id
WHERE p.primary_email = 'example@company.com'
GROUP BY p.person_id;
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "pandas not found" | `pip3 install pandas numpy` |
| Very few candidates | Check `import_log.txt` for details |
| Too many duplicates merged | Adjust matching rules in script |
| Database locked | Close other programs using the DB |
| Out of memory | Reduce BATCH_SIZE to 2500 |
