## 🔍 Profile Search Strategy

### To Find Highly Complete Profiles:
```sql
-- People with LinkedIn + Email + GitHub + 3+ jobs
SELECT * FROM person p
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM person_email pe WHERE pe.person_id = p.person_id)
AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM github_profile gp WHERE gp.person_id = p.person_id)
AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employment e WHERE e.person_id = p.person_id) >= 3;
```
**Result:** ~200 people

### To Find High-Value Targets for Email Enrichment:
```sql
-- High-follower people without emails
SELECT * FROM person p
WHERE p.followers_count > 10000
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM person_email pe WHERE pe.person_id = p.person_id);
```
**Result:** ~50 high-value targets

### To Find Active GitHub Contributors:
```sql
-- People with 100+ GitHub contributions
SELECT p.full_name, gp.github_username, SUM(gc.contribution_count) as total
FROM person p
JOIN github_profile gp ON p.person_id = gp.person_id
JOIN github_contribution gc ON gp.github_profile_id = gc.github_profile_id
GROUP BY p.full_name, gp.github_username
HAVING SUM(gc.contribution_count) > 100;
```
**Result:** ~20 highly active developers
