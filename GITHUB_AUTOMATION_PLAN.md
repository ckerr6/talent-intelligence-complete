# GitHub Automation System - Implementation Plan

## Current State
- **17,534 GitHub profiles** in database
- **207 matched** to people (1.2%)
- **519 have bio data** (3.0% enriched)
- **Coverage**: 0.57% of 35,262 people have GitHub data

## Goals
- Increase matched profiles from 207 → 10,000+ (50%+ of profiles)
- Enrich profiles from 519 → 15,000+ (85%+ of profiles)
- Discover 5,000+ new people from GitHub orgs/repos
- Automate continuous enrichment and matching

## Features

### 1. Smart Discovery
- Find all unenriched profiles (`last_enriched IS NULL OR old`)
- Discover GitHub orgs from company domains
- Find repo contributors
- Prioritize by:
  - Has email/name/location (easier to match)
  - Company employee (higher value)
  - Popular profiles (more followers)
  - Recently active

### 2. Comprehensive Enrichment
Get from GitHub API:
- User profile (name, email, bio, location, company)
- Social links (Twitter, blog, LinkedIn if in bio)
- Activity metrics (repos, followers, following)
- Top repositories
- Primary programming languages
- Organizations/companies
- Recent activity

### 3. Intelligent Matching
Match profiles to existing people:
- **High confidence** (auto-match):
  - Email matches person_email table
  - LinkedIn URL in bio matches person.linkedin_url
- **Medium confidence** (auto-match with logging):
  - Name + company match employment records
  - Email domain + name + location match
- **Low confidence** (flag for review):
  - Name + location match
  - Name similarity + company similarity
- **No match** (create new person):
  - Store as new person record
  - Tag as "needs_review" for manual verification

### 4. Rate Limiting & Resilience
- Respect GitHub API limits (5000/hour authenticated)
- Automatic backoff on rate limit
- Exponential retry on errors
- Checkpoint every 100 records
- Resume from last checkpoint on restart
- Log all errors for debugging

### 5. Monitoring & Status
- Real-time progress dashboard
- Daily summary emails
- Metrics:
  - Profiles enriched/hour
  - Match rate
  - API quota usage
  - Error rate
  - Estimated completion time

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Engine (Week 1, Days 1-2)
- [ ] `github_client.py` - API wrapper with rate limiting
- [ ] `enrichment_engine.py` - Profile enrichment logic
- [ ] `queue_manager.py` - Priority queue
- [ ] Basic tests

### Phase 2: Matching (Week 1, Days 3-4)
- [ ] `matcher.py` - All matching strategies
- [ ] Confidence scoring
- [ ] New person creation logic
- [ ] Matching tests

### Phase 3: Discovery (Week 1, Day 5)
- [ ] `discovery.py` - Org/repo discovery
- [ ] Company domain → GitHub org mapping
- [ ] Contributor extraction
- [ ] Prioritization logic

### Phase 4: Orchestration (Week 2, Days 1-2)
- [ ] `scheduler.py` - Run orchestration
- [ ] Continuous mode (daemon)
- [ ] One-time mode
- [ ] Status tracking

### Phase 5: CLI & Scripts (Week 2, Day 3)
- [ ] `cli.py` - Command-line interface
- [ ] `enrich_github_continuous.py` - Daemon script
- [ ] `github_status.py` - Status dashboard
- [ ] Documentation

### Phase 6: Deployment (Week 2, Days 4-5)
- [ ] Systemd service file (Linux)
- [ ] launchd plist (macOS)
- [ ] Docker container (optional)

- [ ] Backup procedures

## Expected Results

### After Day 1 (Basic Enrichment)
- 1,000 profiles enriched
- Basic matching working
- ~200 new matches

### After Week 1 (Full System)
- 10,000+ profiles enriched (60% coverage)
- 5,000+ matched to existing people (30% match rate)
- 2,000+ new people discovered
- System running continuously

### After Week 2 (Production)
- 15,000+ profiles enriched (85% coverage)
- 8,000+ matched to existing people (50% match rate)
- 5,000+ new people created
- Automated daily updates
- Monitoring dashboards

### Ongoing
- New profiles added automatically from discovered orgs
- Weekly full re-enrichment of stale data
- Continuous matching as new people are added
- Monthly reports on data quality

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: GitHub data for 30%+ of all people (10,500+)
2. **Enrichment**: 85%+ of profiles have complete data
3. **Match Rate**: 50%+ of GitHub profiles matched to people
4. **Discovery**: 5,000+ new people found from GitHub
5. **Freshness**: 95%+ of data refreshed within 30 days
6. **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime, <1% error rate

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Rate Limits**
   - Monitor closely
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Use multiple tokens if needed (rotate)

2. **Data Quality**
   - Validate all data before saving
   - Log confidence scores for all matches
   - Flag low-confidence matches for review
   - Regular audits of match quality

3. **System Reliability**
   - Checkpoint frequently
   - Resume from last checkpoint
   - Error handling and logging
   - Alerts on failures

4. **Cost**
   - GitHub API is free (5000/hour)
   - Compute cost minimal (single process)
   - Storage cost negligible (text data)

## Next Steps

1. Create `github_automation/` directory structure
2. Implement Phase 1 (Core Engine)
3. Test with 100 profiles
4. Implement Phase 2 (Matching)
5. Test matching accuracy
6. Deploy continuous enrichment
7. Monitor and iterate

**Status**: Ready to implement
**Priority**: HIGH (biggest data gap)
**Estimated Time**: 10-15 days to production
**Expected ROI**: 30x increase in GitHub coverage
