# Bug Fixes Summary - Session October 24, 2025

## üîß Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Market Intelligence - Technologists Not Populating
**Issue:** When clicking on technologies in Market Intelligence, the modal opened but no developers populated.

**Root Cause:** SQL error in `api/routers/market_intelligence_enhanced.py`:
```sql
array_agg(DISTINCT gr.full_name ORDER BY gr.stars DESC)
```
PostgreSQL doesn't allow `ORDER BY` on a column not in the `DISTINCT` clause.

**Fix:** Removed `DISTINCT` from `array_agg`:
```sql
array_agg(gr.full_name ORDER BY gr.stars DESC)
```

**File Modified:** `api/routers/market_intelligence_enhanced.py` (line 60)

**Result:** ‚úÖ Technologists now populate correctly with quality scores, tier classification (10x/5x), and sortable views.

### 2. ‚úÖ GitHub Ingestion - No Navigation After Completion
**Issue:** After GitHub ingestion completed, users had no way to navigate to the newly created/updated profile or company page.

**Fix:** Added navigation buttons in `GitHubIngestionModal.tsx`:
- **"View Profile"** button appears when ingesting an individual user
- **"View Company"** button appears when ingesting an organization
- Both buttons automatically navigate to the appropriate page and close the modal

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/github/GitHubIngestionModal.tsx`
  - Added `useNavigate` hook
  - Added conditional navigation buttons based on `result.person_id` or `result.company_id`

**Result:** ‚úÖ Users can now immediately view the profile/company after ingestion completes.

### 3. ‚úÖ Enhanced Network Page - Search Not Working
**Issue:** The multi-node network search page had a search box, but typing in it returned no results.

**Root Cause:** The `/api/people` endpoint didn't support a general `search` parameter. It only had specific filters like `company`, `location`, `headline`.

**Fix:** Added `search` parameter support that searches across:
- Full name
- Headline
- Company name (via employment records)

**Files Modified:**
1. `api/routers/people.py` - Added `search` query parameter
2. `api/crud/person.py` - Added search logic:
```python
if filters.get('search'):
    search_term = f"%{filters['search']}%"
    where_clauses.append("""
        (
            LOWER(p.full_name) LIKE LOWER(%s)
            OR LOWER(p.headline) LIKE LOWER(%s)
            OR EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM employment e
                JOIN company c ON e.company_id = c.company_id
                WHERE e.person_id = p.person_id
                AND LOWER(c.company_name) LIKE LOWER(%s)
            )
        )
    """)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Enhanced Network page search now works - users can search for people by name, title, or company.

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Start the backend:** 
   ```bash
   python run_api.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Technologists Modal:**
   - Go to `/market`
   - Click any technology bar (e.g., "TypeScript")
   - Modal should open showing developers ranked by quality score
   - Try different sort options (Quality, Repos, Stars, Recent)

4. **Test GitHub Ingestion Navigation:**
   - Go to `/search`
   - Click "Add GitHub Data"
   - Enter a GitHub user (e.g., `uni-guillaume`)
   - After ingestion completes, click "View Profile"
   - Should navigate to the person's profile page

5. **Test Enhanced Network Search:**
   - Go to `/network/enhanced` (or click "Network Explorer" from search page)
   - Type a name in the search box (e.g., "Vitalik")
   - Dropdown should appear with matching results
   - Click a person to add them to the graph
   - Add 2-4 people and click "Visualize Network"

## üìä Current Feature Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Working
- Advanced Search (multi-criteria filtering)
- Job Description AI parsing
- GitHub Data Ingestion (individual + organizations)
- Profile Refresh Buttons
- Interactive Market Intelligence (10x/5x engineers)
- Enhanced Network Graph (multi-node, tech filtering)
- Job Title Backfilling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Restart
The API server needs to be restarted to pick up the changes to:
- `api/routers/market_intelligence_enhanced.py`
- `api/routers/people.py`
- `api/crud/person.py`

After restarting, all features should work as expected.
