## 📊 Test Results Summary

### ✅ 1. Importance Scoring Integration (NEW!)

**What We Built**: Integrated importance scoring into search results to rank candidates by impact.

**Changes Made**:
- `api/services/advanced_search_service.py`: Added importance_score to SELECT query
- `api/models/advanced_search.py`: Added importance_score field to SearchResultPerson
- Results now ORDER BY importance_score DESC for maximum relevance

**Test Results**:
```
✅ Search for "Solidity" returns 1,616 candidates
✅ Results ranked by importance (50.0 to 0.0)
✅ Top result: Alex Beregszaszi (score: 50.0)
✅ Second: Georgios Konstantopoulos (score: 50.0)
✅ Third: Matthias Seitz (score: 49.6)
```

**Impact**: Search results are now **intelligently ranked** - most impactful developers appear first!
