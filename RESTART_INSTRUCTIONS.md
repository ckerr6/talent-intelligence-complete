## 🚀 HOW TO RESTART (Critical!)

### Step 1: Stop Everything
```bash
# Stop the API server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
# Stop the frontend (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
```

### Step 2: Restart the Backend
```bash
cd /Users/charlie.kerr/TI_Complete_Clone/talent-intelligence-complete
python run_api.py
```

**Wait for:** `Application startup complete` message

### Step 3: Restart the Frontend
In a **NEW terminal**:
```bash
cd /Users/charlie.kerr/TI_Complete_Clone/talent-intelligence-complete/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache
In your browser:
1. Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

OR just press: **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux)

## ❌ If It Still Doesn't Work

### For GitHub Ingestion:
Check the browser console (F12) for errors. The navigation should trigger immediately when you click "View Profile" or "View Company".

### For Technologists Not Showing:
Check if the API is actually restarted:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/market/enhanced/technology/TypeScript/technologists?limit=5"
```
Should return JSON with developers, not an error.

### For Network Search:
Check if the search endpoint works:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/people?search=vitalik&limit=5"
```
Should return JSON with people results.

## 📊 What Should Work After Restart

✅ GitHub user ingestion → View Profile button → Navigate to profile  
✅ GitHub org ingestion → View Company button → Navigate to company  
✅ Market Intel → Click technology → See ranked developers  
✅ Network Explorer → Search people → Add to graph → Visualize  
✅ Advanced Search → All filters working  
✅ Profile pages → Refresh GitHub button

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check both terminals** - make sure both backend and frontend are running
2. **Check the port** - API should be on port 8000, frontend on 3000
3. **Check browser console** - look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Try incognito mode** - sometimes extensions interfere
5. **Database connection** - make sure PostgreSQL is running

Let me know which specific feature isn't working and what error messages you see!
