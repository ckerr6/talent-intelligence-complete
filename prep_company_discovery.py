Company GitHub Discovery Prep

This script:
1. Finds all companies in database
2. Checks which have GitHub orgs identified
3. Checks which have already been discovered (have repos in company_repositories)
4. Prioritizes companies by:
   - Employee count in our DB
   - Recent activity
   - Strategic importance
5. Generates discovery queue

Output: companies_to_discover.csv - Run these next!
