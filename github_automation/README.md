# GitHub Automation System

**Automated discovery, enrichment, and matching of GitHub profiles to people.**

## üéØ Overview

This system automatically:
1. **Discovers** unenriched GitHub profiles in your database
2. **Enriches** them with data from GitHub API (bio, location, followers, repos, etc.)
3. **Matches** enriched profiles to existing people using multiple strategies
4. **Creates** new person records for high-quality unmatched profiles
5. **Monitors** progress and data quality continuously

### Current Stats
- **17,534 GitHub profiles** in database
- **207 matched** to people (1.2%)
- **519 enriched** (3.0%)

### Goals
- Increase enrichment to **85%+ (15,000+ profiles)**
- Increase matches to **50%+ (8,500+ profiles)**
- Discover **5,000+ new people** from GitHub orgs/repos

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set GitHub Token
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_github_personal_access_token'
```

Get a token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Requires: `public_repo`, `read:user`, `read:org` scopes

### 2. Run Status Check
```bash
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --status-only
```

This shows:
- Current enrichment coverage
- Match rates
- Pending profiles
- Estimated time to complete

### 3. Run Enrichment
```bash
# Enrich 100 profiles (one batch)
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py

# Enrich with matching
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --with-matching

# Continuous mode (runs until stopped)
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --continuous --with-matching
```

### 4. Monitor Progress
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f logs/github_automation/enrichment_*.log
```

## üìã Architecture

```
GitHub Automation System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GitHubClient          # Rate-limited API wrapper
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QueueManager          # Priority queue of profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EnrichmentEngine      # Profile enrichment logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProfileMatcher        # Matching to existing people
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scheduler            # (Future) Cron/daemon mode
```

### Components

#### 1. **GitHubClient** (`github_client.py`)
- Rate-limited GitHub API wrapper
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Request caching (optional)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Statistics tracking

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Respects GitHub rate limits (5000/hour with token)
- ‚úÖ Automatic waiting when rate limit reached
- ‚úÖ Retries on server errors
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging and statistics

#### 2. **QueueManager** (`queue_manager.py`)
- Manages priority queue of profiles to enrich
- Prioritizes by:
  - Never enriched (highest priority)
  - Has email/location (easier to match)
  - High followers (more visible/important)
  - Stale data (>30 days old)

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Smart prioritization
- ‚úÖ Batch processing
- ‚úÖ Status tracking
- ‚úÖ Statistics and monitoring

#### 3. **EnrichmentEngine** (`enrichment_engine.py`)
- Enriches profiles via GitHub API
- Extracts comprehensive data
- Updates database efficiently
- Tracks success/failure rates

**Data Collected:**
- Name, email, bio, location
- Company, blog, Twitter
- Followers, following, public repos
- Programming languages
- Top repositories
- LinkedIn URL (if in bio)
- Hire-ability status

#### 4. **ProfileMatcher** (`matcher.py`)
- Matches GitHub profiles to people
- Multiple strategies with confidence scoring
- Auto-match above threshold
- Creates new person records when appropriate

**Matching Strategies:**
1. **Email match** (95% confidence) - matches person_email table
2. **LinkedIn URL** (99% confidence) - extracted from bio
3. **Name + Company** (85% confidence) - current employment
4. **Name + Location** (70% confidence) - less specific

## üîß Configuration

Edit `github_automation/config.py` to customize:

```python
# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_BUFFER = 100      # Keep N requests in reserve
REQUEST_DELAY = 0.72          # Seconds between requests

# Enrichment
BATCH_SIZE = 100              # Profiles per batch
STALE_DAYS = 30               # Re-enrich after N days

# Matching
AUTO_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.85   # Auto-match if confidence >= this
EMAIL_MATCH_CONFIDENCE = 0.95
NAME_COMPANY_MATCH_CONFIDENCE = 0.85

# Priority Weights
PRIORITY_HAS_EMAIL = 10
PRIORITY_HAS_LOCATION = 5
PRIORITY_HIGH_FOLLOWERS = 8
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Status Dashboard
```bash
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --status-only
```

**Output:**
```
====================================================================
üìä GITHUB ENRICHMENT STATUS
====================================================================

üìà Current State:
  Total GitHub profiles: 17,534
  Enriched profiles: 519 (3.0%)
  Matched to people: 207 (1.2%)
  Pending enrichment: 17,015

üéØ Goals:
  Target enrichment: 85% (14,904 profiles)
  Target matches: 50% (8,767 profiles)

üìã Remaining:
  Need to enrich: 14,385 more profiles
  Need to match: 8,560 more profiles

‚è±Ô∏è  Estimated time to complete: 4.7 hours
   (At ~1 profile/second with GitHub API rate limits)
```

### One-Time Enrichment
```bash
# Enrich 100 profiles
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py

# Enrich 500 profiles
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --batch-size 500

# Enrich and match
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --batch-size 100 --with-matching
```

### Continuous Mode
```bash
# Run continuously (Ctrl+C to stop)
python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --continuous --with-matching
```

**Runs continuously:**
1. Enriches batch of profiles
2. Matches to existing people
3. Shows progress
4. Waits 10 seconds
5. Repeats

### Scheduled Runs (Cron)
```bash
# Add to crontab for hourly enrichment
0 * * * * cd /path/to/project && /usr/bin/python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --batch-size 200 --with-matching >> logs/cron.log 2>&1

# Daily full enrichment at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/project && /usr/bin/python3 enrich_github_continuous.py --batch-size 1000 --with-matching >> logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

## üîç Monitoring

### Log Files
```bash
# Main enrichment log
logs/github_automation/enrichment_YYYYMMDD.log

# Error log (if errors occur)
logs/github_automation/errors_YYYYMMDD.log
```

### Key Metrics
- **Enrichment rate**: profiles/hour
- **Match rate**: % of enriched profiles matched
- **API quota usage**: requests remaining
- **Error rate**: failures/total attempts
- **Data quality**: % complete profiles

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Current stats
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(person_id) as matched,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN bio IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as enriched
FROM github_profile;

-- Match rate by strategy
SELECT 
    source,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM github_profile
WHERE person_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY source;

-- Recent enrichments
SELECT 
    github_username,
    github_name,
    location,
    followers,
    last_enriched
FROM github_profile
WHERE last_enriched >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY last_enriched DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Rate Limit Exceeded
**Symptoms:** "‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit exceeded" messages
**Solution:** 
- System automatically waits for rate limit reset
- Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN is set
- Reduce BATCH_SIZE if needed

### Issue: No Profiles Being Enriched
**Check:**
1. Are there pending profiles? `--status-only`
2. Is GITHUB_TOKEN set? `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. Check logs for errors

### Issue: Low Match Rate
**Solutions:**
- Ensure profiles are enriched first (need email/name/location)
- Check matching thresholds in config.py
- Review low-confidence matches in logs
- May need to adjust matching strategies

### Issue: Database Connection Errors
**Check:**
1. PostgreSQL is running
2. Environment variables set (PGHOST, PGDATABASE, etc.)
3. Connection pool settings in config.py

## üîê Security

### GitHub Token
- Store in environment variable, not code
- Use token with minimal necessary scopes
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Never commit tokens to git

### Database
- Use connection pooling
- Parameterized queries (SQL injection safe)
- Read-only tokens for monitoring
- Backup before major changes

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Run with `--batch-size 10` first to validate
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch logs in real-time to catch issues early
3. **Check Status Often**: Use `--status-only` to track progress
4. **Match After Enriching**: Always use `--with-matching` for best results
5. **Run During Off-Hours**: Less database contention
6. **Backup First**: Backup database before large enrichment runs
7. **Use Continuous Mode**: For unattended operation
8. **Set Alerts**: Monitor error rates and rate limit usage
