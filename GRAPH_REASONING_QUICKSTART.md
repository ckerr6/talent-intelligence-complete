# Graph Reasoning Implementation - Quick Start

**Status**: ✅ READY TO USE  
**Date**: October 25, 2025

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install networkx numpy python-louvain
```

### 2. Start API & Build Graph

```bash
python run_api.py
```

Then in another terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/graph-reasoning/rebuild-graph?limit=5000
```

### 3. Test Features

```bash
# Get stats
curl http://localhost:8000/api/graph-reasoning/stats

# Find key connectors
curl http://localhost:8000/api/graph-reasoning/key-connectors?limit=10
```

Or use the frontend: `http://localhost:5173/graph-reasoning`

## 🎯 What This Does

Implements MIT's GraphReasoning concepts for our talent network:

1. **Find Similar People** - "Who's like this candidate?"
2. **Key Connectors** - "Who bridges different communities?"
3. **Communities** - "What are the developer clusters?"
4. **Path Sampling** - "Connect blockchain → AI experts"

---

## 📊 Example Queries

### Find people similar to someone
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/graph-reasoning/similar-people/{person_uuid}?top_k=10"
```

### Find key influencers
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/graph-reasoning/key-connectors?min_betweenness=0.01"
```

### Detect communities
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/graph-reasoning/detect-communities"
```

### Sample paths between concepts
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/graph-reasoning/path-sampling" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"start_concept": "blockchain", "end_concept": "AI", "max_length": 4}'
```
