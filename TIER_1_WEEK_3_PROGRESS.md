## Priority 1: Skills Taxonomy ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Summary

#### Phase 1: Schema Creation ✅
**File:** `migration_scripts/11_skills_taxonomy.sql`

**Tables Created:**
1. `skills` - Canonical skills taxonomy (93 skills seeded)
2. `person_skills` - Person-to-skill relationships with proficiency
3. `repository_skills` - Repository-to-skill links

**Infrastructure:**
- 12 indexes for optimized querying
- 3 views for easy data access
- 2 helper functions for skill matching
- Seeded with 93 core skills (languages, frameworks, protocols, tools)

#### Phase 2: Rule-Based Skill Extraction ✅
**Files Created:**
- `scripts/skills/extract_skills_from_titles.py` - Extract from job titles/headlines
- `scripts/skills/extract_skills_from_repos.py` - Extract from repository languages

**Extraction Process:**
1. **Title Extraction:**
   - Analyzed 151,537 people
   - Processed 58,430 job titles
   - Extracted 100,255 skill instances
   - Created 91,671 person-skill records
   - Updated 8,584 existing records

2. **Repository Extraction:**
   - Tagged 8,967 repositories with skills
   - Processed 92,382 people with GitHub contributions
   - Created 80,554 person-skill records from repo contributions
   - Updated 12 existing records

#### Phase 3: Proficiency Scoring ✅
Proficiency scores (0-100) calculated based on:

**From Titles:**
- Job seniority level: Junior (25) → Mid (45) → Senior (65) → Lead (75) → Principal/Staff (80) → Distinguished (85) → Fellow/C-level (90)
- Current positions get +10 bonus

**From Repositories:**
- Base: 30 points
- Repos using skill: +10 per repo (max 30)
- Contribution count: +0.01 per contribution (max 20)
- Merged PRs: +2 per PR (max 20)
- **Max proficiency: 100**

**Evidence Sources Tracked:**
- `title` - From job titles
- `headline` - From LinkedIn headlines
- `repos` - From repository contributions
- Multiple sources increase confidence score

### Query 1: Find Solidity Developers
```sql
SELECT p.full_name, p.location, ps.proficiency_score
FROM person p
JOIN person_skills ps ON p.person_id = ps.person_id
JOIN skills s ON ps.skill_id = s.skill_id
WHERE s.skill_name = 'Solidity'
ORDER BY ps.proficiency_score DESC;
```
**Results:** ✅ Found developers with proficiency 40-90
**Top Results:**
- Raman (London) - 90 (CTO-level)
- Max Kaplan (Tampa) - 90 (CTO)
- Multiple Senior/Staff engineers - 80-85
- Mid-level developers - 60-70
- Contributors - 40-60

### Query 2: Find Multi-Skill Developers (Rust + Go)
```sql
-- Find people with both Rust AND Go
SELECT p.full_name, array_agg(s.skill_name) as skills
FROM person p
JOIN person_skills ps ON p.person_id = ps.person_id
JOIN skills s ON ps.skill_id = s.skill_id
WHERE p.person_id IN (
  SELECT person_id FROM person_skills ps1
  JOIN skills s1 ON ps1.skill_id = s1.skill_id
  WHERE s1.skill_name = 'Rust'
  INTERSECT
  SELECT person_id FROM person_skills ps2
  JOIN skills s2 ON ps2.skill_id = s2.skill_id
  WHERE s2.skill_name = 'Go'
)
GROUP BY p.person_id, p.full_name;
```
**Results:** ✅ Found 10+ polyglot developers
**Example:** James Niken (California) - Rust, TypeScript, Go, C++

### Query 3: Top Skills by Popularity
```sql
SELECT s.skill_name, COUNT(DISTINCT ps.person_id) as people_count
FROM skills s
JOIN person_skills ps ON s.skill_id = ps.skill_id
GROUP BY s.skill_name
ORDER BY people_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
**Expected:** JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.

## New Capabilities Unlocked

✅ **Recruiter Searches:**
- "Find Solidity developers in San Francisco"
- "Find senior Rust engineers with 5+ years"
- "Show me full-stack developers (React + Node.js)"
- "Find blockchain developers (Solidity OR Move OR Cairo)"
- "Find polyglot engineers (3+ languages)"

✅ **Skill-Based Filtering:**
- Filter by proficiency score (find only senior-level)
- Filter by evidence sources (title vs. repos vs. both)
- Filter by recency (last_used date)
- Sort by proficiency, confidence, or repo count

✅ **Analytics Queries:**
- Skills distribution across companies
- Skills trends over time (via first_seen/last_used)
- Skills co-occurrence (people with Skill A often have Skill B)
- Skills gaps (roles vs. available talent)

## Why We're Ahead of Schedule

### Original Plan vs. Actual

| Task | Planned Time | Actual Time | Savings |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Schema Creation | 1 day | 2 hours | 6 hours |
| Title Extraction | 2 days | 3 hours | 1.5 days |
| Repo Extraction | 2 days | 2 hours | 1.8 days |
| Proficiency Scoring | 3 days | Integrated | 3 days |
| LLM Validation | 3 days | Skipped | 3 days |
| **Total** | **11 days** | **~1 day** | **10 days** |

### Why So Fast?

1. **Rule-based extraction is sufficient** - 63% coverage without LLM
2. **Database already had rich data** - Job titles and repo languages available
3. **Efficient batch processing** - Processed 151K people in 7 minutes
4. **Proficiency scoring integrated** - No separate computation needed
5. **Well-designed schema** - Indexes optimized from the start

### Trade-offs Made

**Skipped: LLM-based skill validation**
- **Cost:** Would require $200-500 in GPT-4 API calls
- **Benefit:** Would extract soft skills, niche tools, and improve accuracy
- **Decision:** Rule-based gives 63% coverage, sufficient for MVP
- **Future:** Can add LLM validation later if needed

**Limited to primary languages:**
- Only tagged repos with their primary language (e.g., "JavaScript")
- Didn't extract secondary languages or frameworks from repos
- **Future:** Could parse package.json, requirements.txt, etc. for frameworks

## Next Steps: Week 4 Priorities

### Priority 4: Batch GitHub PR Enrichment (Days 22-28)
**Status:** Not started  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM - Mostly batch processing

**Current State:**
- Only 1.98% of profiles have PR stats (2K profiles)
- Target: 60K profiles (60% coverage)

**Plan:**
1. Create `scripts/github/batch_pr_enrichment_orchestrator.py`
2. Prioritize: Linked profiles (98K) → High followers → Ecosystem → Active
3. Run overnight batches (5-7 nights, 5K/hour rate limit)

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 days to implement, 5-7 nights to execute

### Priority 6: Compute Importance Scores (Days 25-26)
**Status:** Not started  
**Complexity:** LOW - Functions already exist

**Plan:**
1. Create `scripts/analytics/compute_all_importance_scores.py`
2. Call `compute_repository_importance()` for 334K repos
3. Call `compute_developer_importance()` for 101K profiles
4. Create indexes, generate reports

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 days

### Optional: LLM-Based Skill Enhancement
**Status:** Deferred  
**Priority:** LOW (already have 63% coverage)

If we want to improve skill coverage beyond 63%, we can:
1. Create `scripts/skills/extract_skills_with_llm.py`
2. Run on high-value profiles (those with emails + GitHub)
3. Extract soft skills, niche tools, and validate existing skills
4. Budget: $200-500 for 10K-20K profiles

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Mitigated
✅ Skills taxonomy complexity - Completed faster than expected  
✅ Data quality - Rule-based extraction sufficient  
✅ Coverage targets - Exceeded 50% target with 63%  

### Remaining Risks
⚠️ **GitHub API Rate Limits** - PR enrichment limited to 5K/hour  
⚠️ **Time for PR enrichment** - Needs 5-7 nights of overnight runs  
⚠️ **Importance score computation** - May be slow for 334K repos  

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start PR enrichment immediately (overnight batches)
- Run importance scoring in parallel during nights
- Can reduce coverage if time is tight (prioritize linked profiles)

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (Day 22 - Today)
1. ✅ **Complete Skills Taxonomy** - DONE
2. **Begin PR Enrichment Setup** - Create orchestrator script

### Day 23-24
1. Run first PR enrichment batch (Tier 1: 98K linked profiles)
2. Create importance scoring script

### Days 25-28
1. Continue PR enrichment (overnight batches)
2. Run importance scoring
3. Final validation and testing

### Day 29
1. Generate final Tier 1 completion report
2. Update QUICK_STATS.txt with new metrics
3. Test all key queries and workflows
