# Emergency Performance Fix Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025 at 15:00  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

---

## üî• The Crisis

This morning, the API and dashboard were **completely unusable**:
- Nothing would load
- Queries hung for hours
- 51+ queries stuck in database
- GitHub profile table had 100K+ rows but was completely locked

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Zombie Queries Holding Locks
- **51 queries** running for 1-5+ hours
- One query "idle in transaction" for **5.5 hours**
- Multiple COUNT queries hung for **2-4 hours**
- All were blocking access to `github_profile` table

**Cause:** Queries started last night during large GitHub import, never completed due to missing indexes

### Problem 2: Missing Critical Indexes
The `edge_coemployment` table (19GB, millions of rows) had **ZERO indexes** on lookup columns:
- No index on `src_person_id`
- No index on `dst_person_id`
- No index on `company_id`

**Result:** Every graph query did full table scan of 19GB ‚Üí hung forever

### Problem 3: Table Never Vacuumed
- `github_profile` had never been manually vacuumed
- Last autovacuum: 13+ hours ago (before large import)
- 5,769 dead rows slowing queries

---

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. Killed Zombie Queries
```
Killed: 51 queries
Time: Instant
Result: Database locks released, queries working again
```

### 2. VACUUM ANALYZE All Tables
```sql
VACUUM ANALYZE github_profile;      -- 303ms
VACUUM ANALYZE edge_coemployment;   -- 8.5 seconds (19GB table!)
VACUUM ANALYZE person;              -- 480ms
VACUUM ANALYZE employment;          -- 357ms
VACUUM ANALYZE company;             -- 178ms
VACUUM ANALYZE person_email;        -- 20ms
```

### 3. Added Critical Indexes

**On edge_coemployment (CRITICAL):**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_edge_coemployment_src ON edge_coemployment(src_person_id, company_id);  -- 454 MB
CREATE INDEX idx_edge_coemployment_dst ON edge_coemployment(dst_person_id, company_id);  -- 454 MB
CREATE INDEX idx_edge_coemployment_company ON edge_coemployment(company_id);             -- 435 MB
```
Total: **1.3GB of new indexes** on graph table

**On employment:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employment_person_company ON employment(person_id, company_id);  -- 10 MB
CREATE INDEX idx_employment_person_dates ON employment(person_id, start_date, end_date);  -- 7.7 MB
CREATE INDEX idx_employment_company_dates ON employment(company_id, start_date, end_date);  -- 6.3 MB
```

**On github_profile:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_github_profile_person_linked ON github_profile(person_id) WHERE person_id IS NOT NULL;  -- 144 KB
```

## üìä Performance Before/After

| Query Type | Before | After | Improvement |
|------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Graph: Get coworkers count** | HUNG (4+ hrs) | 2.06ms | ‚àû |
| **Graph: Get coworkers list** | HUNG (4+ hrs) | 0.96ms | ‚àû |
| **Graph: Company network** | HUNG (2+ hrs) | 2.27ms | ‚àû |
| **Person profile lookup** | Slow/hung | 3.46ms | Very fast |
| **Person employment history** | Slow/hung | 2.93ms | Very fast |
| **GitHub profile count** | HUNG (60+ min) | 13.84ms | ~260,000x |
| **Complex company search** | Very slow | 54.68ms | Fast |
| **Find people with GitHub** | Very slow | 43.88ms | Fast |

---

## ‚úÖ Verified Working

All critical queries now complete in **< 100 milliseconds**:
- ‚úÖ Person profile lookups: ~3ms
- ‚úÖ Graph queries: ~2ms
- ‚úÖ Complex searches: ~50ms
- ‚úÖ Table counts: <100ms

**Your API and dashboard should now load normally.**

## üö® Outstanding Issues

### Issue 1: What's Creating Hung Queries?
We killed 51 hung queries, but there were still 52 active queries immediately after.

**Likely causes:**
1. API endpoints don't have query timeouts
2. Dashboard making parallel requests without limits
3. Some script running continuous queries

**Action needed:**
- Add statement_timeout to all database connections
- Add request timeouts to API
- Investigate what's making so many concurrent requests

### Issue 2: Connection Pool Size
Current: 10 connections max

With 50+ concurrent queries, we're way over capacity.

**Recommendation:**
- Increase to 50-100 connections
- Or add PgBouncer for connection pooling
- Or add rate limiting to API

### Issue 3: No Monitoring
We had no visibility into these issues until the system was completely dead.

**Recommendation:**
- Add query monitoring (log slow queries >1s)
- Add connection monitoring
- Set up alerts for:
  - Query duration > 60s
  - Active connections > 80% of pool
  - Idle in transaction > 5 minutes

## üìù Database Statistics (Actual, from Source)

```
People:                60,045
Companies:             93,164
Employment records:   218,895
GitHub profiles:      100,883 (you were right!)
  - Linked to people:   3,200+ (need to verify exact number)
  - Orphaned:          97,000+
Emails:                3,628
Edge (graph):          millions of edges

## üéØ Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (Do Today)
1. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Kill hung queries
2. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Add critical indexes
3. ‚úÖ **DONE:** VACUUM ANALYZE tables
4. ‚è≥ **TODO:** Add query timeouts to config.py
5. ‚è≥ **TODO:** Add query timeouts to API dependencies
6. ‚è≥ **TODO:** Test dashboard - verify it loads
7. ‚è≥ **TODO:** Monitor for new hung queries

### Short-term (This Week)
8. Increase connection pool size or add PgBouncer
9. Add slow query logging
10. Investigate GitHub profile linkage (only 3% linked)
11. Add API rate limiting
12. Document what caused the large import last night

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
13. Add monitoring/alerting (Sentry or similar)
14. Review and optimize remaining slow queries
15. Consider materialized views for stats endpoints
16. Implement proper connection management in scripts

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Always add indexes BEFORE large imports** - Not after
2. **VACUUM ANALYZE after bulk operations** - Critical for large tables
3. **Set query timeouts** - Prevents runaway queries
4. **Monitor active connections** - Would have caught this early
5. **Graph tables need special care** - Pre-computing relationships is expensive
