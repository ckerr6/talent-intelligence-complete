## Test Cases

### Test Profile 1: 0age
**URL**: http://localhost:3000/profile/679c5f97-d1f8-46a9-bc1b-e8959d4288c2

**Expected to see:**
- ✅ GitHub profile section with username
- ✅ 25 contributions listed
- ✅ Working links to actual GitHub repos
- ✅ PR counts if data exists
- ✅ Quality scores if data exists
- ✅ Career highlights if enriched

### Test Profile 2: Adrian Kant  
**URL**: http://localhost:3000/profile/0612729b-3cf6-304a-7fb3-cf15918809b8

**Expected to see:**
- ✅ GitHub profile for "adjkant"
- ✅ 1 contribution listed
- ✅ Working link to repo
- ✅ All available enrichment data

---

## Next Steps

**After frontend restarts**, the following will work:

1. ✅ All GitHub links work correctly
2. ✅ PR data displays when available
3. ✅ Quality sorting shows best work first
4. ✅ Career highlights visible for enriched profiles
5. ✅ Data is ordered by quality, not just commit count

**For profiles without PR enrichment yet:**
- Will show basic data (commits, stars, dates)
- No PR counts or quality scores (expected)
- Can run enrichment later via `batch_pr_enrichment_orchestrator.py`

---

## Alignment with Tier 1 Plan

This fix supports **Priority 4: Batch GitHub PR Enrichment**:
- ✅ Frontend now displays all enriched PR data
- ✅ Proper sorting prioritizes quality contributors
- ✅ Career highlights showcase total impact
- ⏳ Ready for batch enrichment execution (Days 22-28)

**When you run the batch enrichment**, all this data will populate automatically and display beautifully! 🎉
