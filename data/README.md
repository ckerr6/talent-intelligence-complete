# Data Directory

CSV files and data exports.

## Structure

- `imports/` - Source CSV files for imports
- `github/` - GitHub data exports
- `exports/` - Database exports and samples

## Note

CSV files are typically ignored by git (see `.gitignore`).
This directory is for organizing local data files.
