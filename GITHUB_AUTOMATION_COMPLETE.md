### Key Features

#### 1. Smart Prioritization
Profiles are enriched in priority order:
- **Highest**: Never enriched, has email
- **High**: Has location/company data
- **Medium**: High follower count
- **Low**: Basic profiles with minimal data

#### 2. Rate Limiting
- Automatic rate limit detection
- Waits when limit reached
- 0.72 second delay between requests
- Buffer of 100 requests maintained

#### 3. Error Handling
- Exponential backoff on errors
- Retries up to 3 times
- Comprehensive logging
- Graceful degradation

#### 4. Matching Strategies
**Email Match (95% confidence)**
- Matches github_email → person_email table
- Highest confidence, auto-matched

**LinkedIn Match (99% confidence)**
- Extracts LinkedIn URL from bio
- Matches to person.normalized_linkedin_url
- Very high confidence

**Name + Company (85% confidence)**
- Matches github_name + github_company
- Checks current employment records
- High confidence, auto-matched

**Name + Location (70% confidence)**
- Matches github_name + location
- Less specific but still useful
- Logged for review if below threshold

#### 5. Data Enrichment
**Collected from GitHub API:**
- Profile data: name, email, bio, location
- Company, blog URL, Twitter handle
- Metrics: followers, following, repos count
- Repository languages
- Top repositories (by stars)
- Account creation/update dates
- Hire-ability status
- LinkedIn URL (extracted from bio)

## 🔍 Database Impact

### Tables Updated

#### 1. `github_profile`
**Fields Populated:**
- `github_name` - Full name
- `github_email` - Email address
- `github_company` - Company name
- `bio` - Profile bio
- `blog` - Website URL
- `location` - Location string
- `twitter_username` - Twitter handle
- `followers` - Follower count
- `following` - Following count
- `public_repos` - Repository count
- `hireable` - Hire-able flag
- `avatar_url` - Profile image
- `created_at_github` - GitHub join date
- `updated_at_github` - Last GitHub update
- `last_enriched` - Our enrichment timestamp
- `person_id` - Linked person (when matched)

#### 2. `person`
**Indirectly Updated** (via matching):
- Existing people get linked GitHub profiles
- New people created from high-quality profiles

#### 3. `person_email`
**Indirectly Updated**:
- GitHub emails added for new people
- Source tagged as 'github_enrichment'

### Sample Queries
```sql
-- Recently enriched profiles
SELECT 
    github_username,
    github_name,
    github_company,
    location,
    followers,
    last_enriched,
    person_id IS NOT NULL as matched
FROM github_profile
WHERE last_enriched >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY followers DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Enrichment progress by day
SELECT 
    DATE(last_enriched) as date,
    COUNT(*) as enriched,
    COUNT(person_id) as matched
FROM github_profile
WHERE last_enriched IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE(last_enriched)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Top matched companies
SELECT 
    gp.github_company,
    COUNT(*) as profile_count,
    COUNT(gp.person_id) as matched_count
FROM github_profile gp
WHERE gp.github_company IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY gp.github_company
ORDER BY matched_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## ⚡ Performance

### Throughput
- **With Token**: ~3,600 profiles/hour (limited by GitHub API rate)
- **Without Token**: ~54 profiles/hour (60/hour limit)
- **Matching**: ~10,000 profiles/minute (local processing)

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Low (~5% on modern systems)
- **Memory**: Low (~100-200 MB)
- **Network**: Moderate (API calls only)
- **Database**: Light load (batch updates)

### Bottlenecks
1. **GitHub API Rate Limit** - Primary bottleneck (5000/hour)
2. **Network Latency** - ~100-300ms per request
3. **Database Commits** - Batched every 100 profiles

### Optimization Tips
- Use multiple GitHub tokens (rotating)
- Run during off-peak hours
- Increase batch size for faster commits
- Use connection pooling (already implemented)

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Rate Limit Exceeded
**Symptom**: "⚠️ Rate limit exceeded"
**Action**: System automatically waits for reset
**Prevention**: Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN is set

#### Profile Not Found
**Symptom**: HTTP 404 errors
**Action**: Profile marked as failed, will retry later
**Cause**: Username changed or account deleted

#### Network Errors
**Symptom**: Timeout or connection errors
**Action**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
**Max Retries**: 3 attempts

#### Database Errors
**Symptom**: SQL errors in logs
**Action**: Transaction rolled back, logged for review
**Prevention**: Validate data before insertion

### Recovery Procedures

1. **System Crashes**
   - Re-run with same command
   - Continues from where it left off
   - No duplicate enrichments

2. **Partial Enrichment**
   - Profiles marked as enriched only on success
   - Failed profiles retry on next run
   - Use `queue.reset_failed(days=7)` to force retry

3. **Bad Data**
   - Validation before database insertion
   - Nulls preserved for missing data
   - Logs show what was skipped

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### GitHub Token Security
- ✅ Token stored in environment variable
