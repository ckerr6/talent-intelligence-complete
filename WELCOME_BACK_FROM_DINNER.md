**Target:** 2,000 high-quality profiles  
**Started:** October 23, 2025 @ 5:20 PM  
**Expected Completion:** ~5:47 PM (27 minutes)

## üìä **Check Your Progress:**

Run this command to see results:
```bash
./check_enrichment_progress.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Quick stats
psql -d talent -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as enriched FROM github_profile WHERE enriched_at IS NOT NULL;"

# Top contributors
psql -d talent -c "SELECT p.full_name, gp.total_merged_prs, gp.total_lines_contributed FROM github_profile gp JOIN person p ON gp.person_id = p.person_id WHERE gp.total_merged_prs > 0 ORDER BY gp.total_merged_prs DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

## üîç **Where to See the New Data:**

### **1. Search for High-Quality Contributors:**

Go to http://localhost:3000 and search by company:
- Trust Wallet
- Balancer  
- Chainrisk
- Aztec
- Any blockchain company

### **2. View Enriched Profiles:**

Look for the GitHub Activity section with:

**Green Card:**
```
‚úì 97 Merged Pull Requests
Confirmed code contributions
```

**Blue Card:**
```
37,404 Lines of Code
Career total contributed
```

**Purple Badge (if Pro account):**
```
‚úì GitHub Pro
Has private repositories
```

## üéØ **Expected Results:**

Based on early enrichment (first 9 profiles):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Profiles Enriched | ~2,000 |
| High-Quality Contributors (50+ PRs) | ~50-100 expected |
| Total Merged PRs Collected | ~20,000-30,000 estimated |
| Total Lines of Code | ~5-10 million lines |

### **Notable Early Finds:**
- Mikhail Wall (@zkokelj): 76 merged PRs, 37,404 lines
- Santiago Palladino: 7 merged PRs, 850 lines

---

## üêõ **If Something Went Wrong:**

### **Check if process completed:**
```bash
ps aux | grep "07_github_pr_enrichment.py"
```
- If empty = completed ‚úÖ
- If running = still going üîÑ

### **Check for errors:**
```bash
tail -50 logs/pr_enrichment_*.log
```

Look for the final summary:
```
============================================================
‚úÖ Enrichment complete!
   Success: X/2000
   Errors: Y/2000
============================================================
```

### **If it failed:**
Check the log for rate limit errors:
```bash
grep -i "rate limit" logs/pr_enrichment_*.log
```

If hit rate limit, just restart with remaining profiles:
```bash
export $(cat .env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
python3 enrichment_scripts/07_github_pr_enrichment.py --batch-size 1000
```

## üé® **Sample Queries to Try:**

### **Find Prolific Contributors:**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.full_name,
    p.headline,
    gp.github_username,
    gp.total_merged_prs,
    gp.total_lines_contributed
FROM github_profile gp
JOIN person p ON gp.person_id = p.person_id
WHERE gp.total_merged_prs >= 50
ORDER BY gp.total_merged_prs DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### **Find Recent High-Quality Work:**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.full_name,
    gp.total_merged_prs,
    gp.enriched_at::date as when_enriched
FROM github_profile gp
JOIN person p ON gp.person_id = p.person_id
WHERE gp.enriched_at >= CURRENT_DATE
  AND gp.total_merged_prs > 0
ORDER BY gp.total_merged_prs DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### **Distribution Analysis:**
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN total_merged_prs >= 100 THEN '100+ PRs (Elite)'
        WHEN total_merged_prs >= 50 THEN '50-99 PRs (Expert)'
        WHEN total_merged_prs >= 20 THEN '20-49 PRs (Strong)'
        WHEN total_merged_prs >= 5 THEN '5-19 PRs (Solid)'
        WHEN total_merged_prs > 0 THEN '1-4 PRs (Active)'
        ELSE '0 PRs'
    END as tier,
    COUNT(*) as developers
FROM github_profile
WHERE enriched_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tier
ORDER BY MIN(total_merged_prs) DESC;
```
