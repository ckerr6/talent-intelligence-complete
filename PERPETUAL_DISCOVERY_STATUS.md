# ðŸŒ™ Perpetual Discovery Engine - Running All Night!

## ðŸš€ System Status: ACTIVE

**Start Time:** October 24, 2025 @ 02:57 AM  
**Mode:** PERPETUAL - Runs continuously in cycles until manually stopped  

## How It Works

The Perpetual Discovery Engine runs in **continuous cycles**, with each cycle:

1. **Finding Unprocessed Repos** - Queries database for repos that need contributor sync
2. **Processing 10 Repos** - Discovers contributors for each repo (100 per repo)
3. **Enriching Profiles** - Fetches full GitHub data for new contributors
4. **Discovering Related Repos** - Finds repos from notable developers
5. **Repeat Forever** - 10 second pause, then starts next cycle

### What Gets Discovered:

- âœ… **All repos in database** (prioritized by stars and ecosystem)
- âœ… **Top 100 contributors** per repository
- âœ… **Full GitHub profiles** (bio, location, company, stats)
- âœ… **Related repositories** from discovered developers
- âœ… **Network expansion** around notable developers
- âœ… **Ecosystem tagging** and importance scoring

## Live Monitoring

### Watch Live Activity (Recommended):

```bash
./watch_perpetual.sh
```

Shows live, colorized output with:
- ðŸ“¦ Repositories being processed
- ðŸ‘¤ Contributors being discovered
- ðŸ“Š Statistics after each cycle
- âœ¨ New developers found
- ðŸ”„ Cycle status

**Press Ctrl+C to stop watching** (engine keeps running)

### Quick Status Check:

```bash
cd /Users/charlie.kerr/TI_Complete_Clone/talent-intelligence-complete
ps -p $(cat logs/perpetual_pid.txt) && echo "ðŸŸ¢ RUNNING" || echo "ðŸ”´ STOPPED"
```

### View Raw Log:

```bash
tail -f logs/perpetual_discovery_*.log
```

## Expected Overnight Results

By morning, the engine will have completed **50-100+ cycles**, discovering:

- **500+ repositories processed**
- **10,000+ contributors enriched**
- **100-500 NEW developers** added to database
- **Network expansion** around crypto ecosystem
- **Related repos discovered** from notable developers

## Understanding the Stats

After each cycle, you'll see:

```
ðŸ“Š PERPETUAL DISCOVERY STATS
================================
Cycles completed:        1
Repos discovered:        0
Repos processed:         10
Contributors discovered: 1
Contributors enriched:   766
API calls made:          16
Errors encountered:      5
```

**Explained:**
- **Cycles completed** - How many cycles have run
- **Repos discovered** - New repos found and added to database
- **Repos processed** - Repos where contributors were synced
- **Contributors discovered** - NEW profiles created
- **Contributors enriched** - Existing profiles updated
- **API calls** - GitHub API requests (we have 5,000/hour limit)
- **Errors** - Minor errors (timeouts, rate limits) - normal!

## Morning Check

When you wake up, run:

```bash
# Quick summary
./check_overnight_results.sh

# Or check the log
tail -100 logs/perpetual_discovery_*.log | grep "STATS" -A 10 | tail -15
```

## Database Queries to Try

### See all newly discovered developers from tonight:

```sql
SELECT 
    gp.github_username,
    gp.github_name,
    gp.github_company,
    gp.location,
    gp.followers,
    gp.public_repos,
    gp.created_at
FROM github_profile gp
WHERE gp.created_at >= '2025-10-24 02:57:00'
ORDER BY gp.followers DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### See which repos are being processed:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.full_name,
    r.stars,
    r.last_contributor_sync,
    r.contributor_count
FROM github_repository r
WHERE r.last_contributor_sync >= '2025-10-24 02:57:00'
ORDER BY r.last_contributor_sync DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

### See top contributors discovered:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.full_name as repo,
    gp.github_username,
    gp.followers,
    gc.contribution_count,
    gc.created_at
FROM github_contribution gc
JOIN github_profile gp ON gc.github_profile_id = gp.github_profile_id
JOIN github_repository r ON gc.repo_id = r.repo_id
WHERE gc.created_at >= '2025-10-24 02:57:00'
ORDER BY gc.contribution_count DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## Stopping the Engine

If you need to stop it:

```bash
# Find the process
cat logs/perpetual_pid.txt

# Kill it
pkill -f perpetual_discovery.py

# Or specific PID
kill $(cat logs/perpetual_pid.txt)
```

The engine will save all data before stopping.

## Restarting

If it stops for any reason:

```bash
cd /Users/charlie.kerr/TI_Complete_Clone/talent-intelligence-complete
nohup python3 scripts/github/perpetual_discovery.py > logs/perpetual_discovery_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
echo $! > logs/perpetual_pid.txt
```

## Rate Limiting

- **GitHub API Limit:** 5,000 requests/hour
- **Current Rate:** ~100 requests/cycle (~10-20 requests/minute)
- **Safe:** We're well within limits with automatic backoff

If rate limited:
- Engine automatically sleeps for 60 seconds
- Continues processing after rate limit resets
- No data loss

## Error Handling

The engine handles:
- âœ… API timeouts - Retries automatically
- âœ… Rate limits - Sleeps and continues
- âœ… Database errors - Rolls back and continues
- âœ… Missing repos - Logs and skips
- âœ… Invalid data - Logs and continues

All errors are logged but won't stop the engine!

## What Happens Next

The engine will run ALL NIGHT discovering:

1. **Hour 1-2:** Process high-priority repos (Ethereum, Paradigm, etc.)
2. **Hour 3-4:** Expand into related repos from notable developers
3. **Hour 5-6:** Continue discovery of lower-priority repos
4. **All Night:** Continuous cycles building comprehensive database
