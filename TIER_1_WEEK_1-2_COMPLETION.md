## Priority 5: Email Data Migration ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Done
1. Created `migration_scripts/10_complete_email_migration.sql`
2. Migrated 2,584 GitHub emails to `person_email` table
3. Fixed 50 people with missing primary email designation
4. Verified all import scripts already use `person_email` table

### Results
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| People with Emails | 26,610 (16.96%) | 28,964 (18.46%) | +8.8% |
| Total Email Records | 60,516 | 63,100 | +2,584 |
| Email Type Coverage | - | Work: 59.8%, Personal: 30.2% | - |

### Files Created
- `migration_scripts/10_complete_email_migration.sql`
- `migration_scripts/10_complete_email_migration_COMPLETED.md`

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All emails consolidated in `person_email` table

---

## Priority 2: GitHub Profile Matching ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE

### Discovery
When we ran diagnostics, we discovered ALL GitHub profiles are already matched:
- Total GitHub Profiles: 101,485
- Profiles Linked: 101,485 (100%)
- Unique People with GitHub: 98,695 (62.91% of all people)

### Analysis
The data team's report showed 4.17% linkage, but current database shows 100%. This suggests matching was completed between their analysis and now.

### What Was Created
Created `scripts/github/match_github_profiles_improved.py` with enhanced features for future use:
- Lower confidence threshold (85% → 70%)
- Fuzzy name matching with Levenshtein distance
- Better company name normalization
- Enhanced email matching

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - No action needed, script ready for future use

---

## Priority 3: Crypto Ecosystems ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE

### Current State

| Metric | Count | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Ecosystems Defined | 210 | 100+ | ✅ Exceeded |
| Ecosystem-Repo Links | 716,228 | 100K+ | ✅ Exceeded |
| Repos Tagged | 319,573 | 50K+ | ✅ Exceeded |
| Company-Ecosystem Links | 49 | 500+ | ⚠️ Low |
| Person-Ecosystem Activity | 5,641 | 30K+ | ⚠️ Lower than target |
| Unique People in Ecosystems | 2,448 | - | ✅ Good |

### What Was Done
1. Verified ecosystem taxonomy already imported (210 ecosystems)
2. Verified ecosystem_repository links exist (716K links)
3. **Updated `github_repository.ecosystem_ids` array** (319K repos tagged)
4. **Computed `person_ecosystem_activity` table** (5.6K records for 2.4K people)

### Top Ecosystems by Developer Count
1. Ethereum Virtual Machine Stack - 2,420 developers
2. Avalanche - 1,429 developers
3. Ethereum - 885 developers
4. Ethereum L2s - 151 developers
5. Uniswap - 147 developers
6. Paradigm - 127 developers
7. Cosmos Network - 101 developers
8. Base - 40 developers
9. Solana - 37 developers

### Why Numbers Are Lower Than Target
- Only 62.91% of people have GitHub profiles
- Only ~2.5% of GitHub profiles (2,448) have contributions to tracked ecosystem repos
- Many developers work on proprietary/non-ecosystem projects

**Status:** ✅ **FUNCTIONAL** - Core capability working, can search "Ethereum developers"

---

## Week 1-2 Summary

### Time Saved
- **Email Migration:** 2 days planned → 1 day actual (already mostly done)
- **GitHub Matching:** 3 days planned → 0 days (already complete)
- **Ecosystem Import:** 5 days planned → 1 day (already imported, just updated)

**Total:** Saved 8 days out of 10 planned

### Database Improvements

| Metric | Before Week 1 | After Week 2 | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Email Coverage | 16.96% | 18.46% | +1.5% |
| GitHub Linkage | 100% | 100% | Maintained |
| Repos with Ecosystems | 0% | 95.7% | +95.7% |
| People in Ecosystems | 0 | 2,448 | +2,448 |
| Ecosystem-Repo Links | 716K | 716K | Verified |

### New Capabilities Unlocked

✅ **Can now query:**
- "Find people who contributed to Ethereum"
- "Show me Avalanche ecosystem developers"
- "Find Uniswap contributors"
- "Show developers active in multiple ecosystems"

✅ **Can now filter by:**
- Ecosystem name
- Contribution count to ecosystem
- Number of repos contributed to per ecosystem

## Next Steps: Week 3-4

### Priority 1: Skills Taxonomy (Days 11-24)
**Status:** Not started  
**Complexity:** HIGH - Most complex task in Tier 1

**Plan:**
1. Create skills taxonomy schema (3 tables)
2. Build rule-based skill extraction (titles, repos)
3. Add LLM-based skill validation (GPT-4)
4. Compute proficiency scores
5. Validate and iterate

**Target:**
- 500+ unique skills
- 80K+ person-skill relationships (50%+ coverage)
- 100K+ repo-skill relationships

### Priority 4: PR Enrichment (Days 22-28, parallel)
**Status:** Not started  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM - Mostly batch processing

**Plan:**
1. Create batch orchestrator script
2. Run overnight batches (5-7 nights)
3. Prioritize: linked profiles → high followers → ecosystem → active

**Target:**
- 60K profiles enriched (60% of 100K)
- Merged PR counts, code volume, quality scores

### Priority 6: Compute Importance Scores (Days 25-26)
**Status:** Not started  
**Complexity:** LOW - Functions already exist

**Plan:**
1. Call `compute_repository_importance()` for all repos
2. Call `compute_developer_importance()` for all profiles
3. Create indexes, generate reports

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Mitigated
✅ Email migration complexity - Was already mostly done  
✅ GitHub matching difficulty - Already 100% complete  
✅ Ecosystem import complexity - Already imported, just needed updates

### Remaining Risks
⚠️ **Skills Taxonomy Complexity** - Most complex task, may take longer than 2 weeks  
⚠️ **LLM Costs** - GPT-4 skill extraction for 10K-20K profiles ($200-500)  
⚠️ **GitHub API Rate Limits** - PR enrichment limited to 5K/hour  

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start skills taxonomy immediately (Week 3)
- Budget $500 for LLM costs (get approval first)
- Run PR enrichment overnight in batches
- Can reduce LLM coverage if needed (rule-based only for most profiles)

*Note: Original report numbers were outdated or measured differently

### Platform Completeness

| Phase | Original | Current | Target |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|

## Conclusion

**Week 1-2 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & AHEAD OF SCHEDULE**

We've completed or verified completion of 3 out of 5 Tier 1 priorities. Several tasks that were expected to require significant work were already done, allowing us to move faster than planned.

The remaining two priorities (Skills Taxonomy and PR Enrichment) are the most complex and time-consuming tasks in Tier 1. They will require the full Week 3-4 timeframe.

**Recommendation:** Begin Skills Taxonomy implementation immediately (Day 11) as it's the most complex task and critical for recruiter workflows.
