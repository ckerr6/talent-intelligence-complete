**Started**: October 24, 2025 - 2:40 AM  
**Status**: ✅ Active (PID: 42741)  
**Mode**: Comprehensive Discovery with Live Logging

---

## 🎯 What's Running Now

### **ENHANCED Overnight Discovery**

This is now a **complete ecosystem discovery** that includes:

#### Phase 1: Electric Capital Taxonomy Parsing ⏳
- Downloading the complete crypto-ecosystems taxonomy
- Parsing priority ecosystems (Tier 1-2):
  - Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum
  - Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Maker, Curve
  - Paradigm, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche
  - And ~50+ more priority ecosystems
- Importing **1,000+ ecosystems**
- Linking **10,000+ repositories** to ecosystems
- **Expected time**: 30-45 minutes

#### Phase 2: Priority Repository Loading ⏳
- Loading the top 50 priority repositories
- Sorted by:
  - Ecosystem priority (Tier 1 first)
  - Repository stars (most popular first)
  - Last contributor sync (oldest first)
- Including:
  - ethereum/EIPs
  - All paradigmxyz/* repos
  - Uniswap repos
  - Major DeFi protocols
  - Infrastructure tools

#### Phase 3: Contributor Discovery ⏳
- For each of the 50 priority repos:
  - Fetch ALL contributors from GitHub API
  - Enrich each profile:
    - Name, bio, location, company
    - Email, blog, Twitter
    - Followers, repos, activity
  - Tag with ecosystems:
    - `ethereum`, `eip-author`, `paradigm-ecosystem`
    - `defi`, `uniswap`, etc.
  - Create contribution records
  - Track discovery lineage
- **Expected: 5,000+ developers discovered**
- **Expected time**: 5-8 hours

## 🌅 Morning Results

When you wake up, you'll have:

### Database

✅ **1,000+ crypto ecosystems** organized hierarchically  
✅ **10,000+ repositories** linked to ecosystems  
✅ **5,000+ developers** discovered and enriched  
✅ **Complete lineage tracking** for every entity  
✅ **Ecosystem tags** on every developer  
✅ **Importance scores** computed  

### Queries You Can Run

**All EIP authors**:

WHERE 'eip-author' = ANY(ecosystem_tags)
ORDER BY importance_score DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Paradigm ecosystem developers**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_top_developers 
WHERE 'paradigm-ecosystem' = ANY(ecosystem_tags)
ORDER BY importance_score DESC;
```

**Developers across multiple ecosystems**:
```sql
SELECT github_username, ecosystem_tags,
       array_length(ecosystem_tags, 1) as ecosystem_count
FROM github_profile
WHERE array_length(ecosystem_tags, 1) >= 3
ORDER BY ecosystem_count DESC;
```

**Top Ethereum developers**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_top_developers 
WHERE 'ethereum' = ANY(ecosystem_tags)
ORDER BY importance_score DESC

## 🔍 Process Details

### How Taxonomy Parsing Works

1. Downloads Electric Capital's crypto-ecosystems repo
2. Runs their export script to generate JSONL
3. Parses each ecosystem entry:
   - Creates ecosystem record
   - Identifies parent/child relationships
   - Extracts all repository URLs
4. Creates repository records for each repo
5. Links repos to ecosystems
6. Assigns priority scores

### How Contributor Discovery Works

1. Queries database for priority repos
2. For each repo:
   - Fetches contributors from GitHub API
   - Sorts by contribution count
   - For each contributor:
     - Checks if already exists
     - Fetches full user profile
     - Enriches with metadata
     - Determines ecosystem tags based on repo
     - Creates/updates profile
     - Creates contribution record
     - Records discovery event
3. Commits to database every 10 contributors
4. Updates progress stats

### Live Logging Shows

For each contributor discovered:
```
[045/234] gakonst                        | 187 contributions
          Name: Georgios Konstantopoulos | Company: Paradigm | Location: Athens | ⭐ 5,234 followers
```
